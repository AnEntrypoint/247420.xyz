In addition to being an experienced programmer skilled in JavaScript, I also enjoy making improvisational music, creating 3D animation and graphic design, growing leafy vegetables, and appreciating cheese, triangles, and cats.\n\nAs someone who values personal growth and deep, meaningful relationships, I take a considered approach to decision-making, weighing my personal values and emotions alongside logic and analysis. I tend to be introverted in my interactions with others, but that doesn't mean I don't value social connections. I just prefer a smaller, more intimate social circle. When faced with conflict or disagreement, I advocate for my position, standing firm in my beliefs while also being open to hearing and considering the perspectives of others.\n\nI am adaptable and able to roll with the punches when faced with new or unexpected situations, although I may approach them with caution at first. When faced with problems or challenges, I prefer to consider all options and possibilities before making a decision, rather than rushing in head-first.\n\nOne of the things I enjoy most is improvisational work, whether it be in music or other creative pursuits. The freedom and spontaneity of improvisation allows for endless possibilities and the opportunity to constantly learn and grow. It also encourages being present in the moment and reacting to one's surroundings in a genuine and authentic way. Overall, I am a thoughtful and introspective individual who values personal growth and deep connections with others, and I find great joy in the creative process of improvisation.","Rumble":"","Posts":[{"__typename":"Post","id":"0x01ac47-0xa2","createdAt":"2023-08-21T07:18:26.000Z","metadata":{"name":"New Post by @teknopath.lens","description":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8YpOPajKQE\n# Dub Intercepta (Original Audio) Live at WaVeS Live DUB at WaVeS Teknopath 🎶🎸🥁\n\nHey everyone!

From entertainment to education, videos have the power to captivate and engage audiences like no other medium. As content creators, we are constantly seeking ways to optimize our videos to reach a wider audience and gain more love from our viewers. One emerging trend in the world of video content is the rise of shorter videos, commonly known as #shorts. But the question remains: will shorter videos really get us more love?\n\nThis experiment aims to explore the impact of shorter videos on audience engagement and love. Instead of investing time and effort into creating long, hard-to-produce videos, I decided to take a different approach. I focused on creating high-quality videos with concise and impactful content, specifically tailored for the short video format.\n\nThe rationale behind this experiment is simple. In today's fast-paced world, people have shorter attention spans and are constantly bombarded with information. As a result, they tend to gravitate towards shorter, bite-sized content that can be consumed quickly and easily. By adapting to this trend, I hoped to capture the attention of a wider audience and increase the love and engagement for my videos.\n\nTo conduct this experiment, I created a series of short videos, each ranging from 15 to 60 seconds in length. These videos covered a variety of topics, ranging from tutorials and product reviews to entertaining skits and behind-the-scenes footage. I made sure to maintain a high level of production quality, ensuring that the videos were visually appealing and engaging.\n\nOnce the videos were created, I strategically released them on various social media platforms, including YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok. I utilized relevant hashtags such as #shorts to maximize their visibility and reach. Additionally, I incorporated emojis in the video titles and descriptions to make them more eye-catching and relatable to the audience.\n\nThe initial results of this experiment were astounding. Within a short period of time, the shorter videos started gaining traction and generating a significant amount of love and engagement. The view counts skyrocketed, and the videos received a higher number of likes, comments, and shares compared to my longer, more traditional videos.\n\nAnalyzing the data further, I discovered that the shorter videos had a higher retention rate, indicating that viewers were more likely to watch the entire video without losing interest. This was a clear indication that the shorter format was indeed capturing and holding the attention of the audience.\n\nMoreover, the shorter videos also had a higher shareability factor. Viewers were more inclined to share these bite-sized videos with their friends and followers, amplifying their reach and potentially attracting new viewers to my content. The use of hashtags such as #shorts played a crucial role in this process, as it helped my videos appear in relevant search results and recommendations.\n\nAnother interesting observation was the increased interaction and engagement from viewers. The shorter format seemed to encourage viewers to leave comments, ask questions, and share their thoughts more frequently. This created a sense of community and connection, fostering a deeper level of engagement and love for my content.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that while shorter videos can be effective in capturing attention and generating initial engagement, they may not always provide the same level of depth and substance as longer videos. Some topics require a more comprehensive approach, and condensing them into a short video may limit the amount of information that can be conveyed.\n\nIn conclusion, the experiment has shown that shorter videos, or #shorts, can indeed get you more love and engagement from your audience. By adapting to the fast-paced nature of today's digital landscape, and creating high-quality, concise content, you can capture the attention of a wider audience and increase the love for your videos. However, it is important to strike a balance between shorter and longer videos, ensuring that you provide both bite-sized content for quick consumption and more in-depth content for those seeking a deeper understanding.\n\nSo, if you're looking to boost your engagement and capture the hearts of your viewers, give shorter videos a try. Embrace the power of #shorts and watch your love and engagement soar! 🚀❤️","content":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWOmg6YAIMc\n# Will shorter videos get me more love? #shorts 😍🎥\n\nIn today's digital age, video content has become an integral part of our lives.

Get ready for an awe-inspiring musical journey! 🎵🔥\n\n## The Setup 🎛️\n\nFor this performance, I am using two main tools: Ableton and the RC505 MK2. Ableton is a versatile digital audio workstation that allows for seamless integration of various instruments and effects. The RC505 MK2, on the other hand, is a powerful loop station that enables live looping and recording.\n\nTo create a unique and immersive experience, I have set up a pedal arrangement that includes various effects pedals such as delay, reverb, and distortion. These pedals add depth and texture to the sound, enhancing the overall performance.\n\n## The Technique 🎶\n\nThe technique I am using involves a combination of live looping and real-time manipulation of audio samples. I start by recording a short musical phrase or beat using the RC505 MK2. Once recorded, I can loop this phrase and layer additional elements on top of it.\n\nUsing Ableton, I can then manipulate these loops further by adding effects, adjusting the tempo, or even reversing the audio. This allows me to create intricate and dynamic soundscapes that evolve throughout the performance.\n\n## The Performance 🎵\n\nAs I begin the performance, I tap into the rhythmic capabilities of the RC505 MK2. I create a solid beat using the built-in drum sounds and layer it with a catchy bassline. This forms the foundation of the performance, providing a groove that the audience can connect with.\n\nNext, I start adding melodic elements using a MIDI controller connected to Ableton. I trigger different virtual instruments and synths, creating harmonies and melodies that complement the rhythm. The combination of live looping and MIDI control allows me to build complex musical arrangements on the fly.\n\nThroughout the performance, I experiment with different effects and pedal combinations. I use the delay pedal to create mesmerizing echoes, the reverb pedal to add depth and space, and the distortion pedal to add grit and intensity. These effects help me shape the sound and add a touch of uniqueness to each section of the performance.\n\n## The Experience 🌟\n\nThe beauty of this live looping technique is that it allows for endless possibilities and improvisation. Each performance is a unique experience, as I can adapt and respond to the energy of the audience in real-time. The combination of Ableton and the RC505 MK2 gives me the flexibility to create complex and captivating musical compositions on the spot.\n\nAs the performance reaches its climax, I unleash a flurry of sound, layering loops upon loops, creating a sonic tapestry that envelops the audience. The energy in the room is palpable, and everyone is captivated by the immersive experience.\n\n## Conclusion 🎉\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of Ableton and the RC505 MK2 opens up a world of possibilities for live looping performances. The ability to manipulate audio in real-time, along with the flexibility of the pedal arrangement, allows for a truly unique and captivating musical experience.\n\nIf you're a music enthusiast or a performer looking to push the boundaries of live looping, I highly recommend exploring this experimental technique.

We were all set to play in the dark together, powered by a trusty battery bank. And what made this Friday even more special? It was 420, a day celebrated by cannabis enthusiasts worldwide. 🎉🌿\n\nAs the sun began to set, casting a beautiful orange glow over the construction site, we gathered around, eagerly anticipating the start of our 420 adventure. The air was filled with excitement and a sense of camaraderie, as we knew we were about to embark on a memorable experience.\n\nWith the battery bank fully charged, we were ready to dive into the world of darkness. The absence of artificial light heightened our senses, making every sound and movement more pronounced. It was a unique way to connect with nature and ourselves, away from the distractions of the modern world.\n\nAs the first puff of smoke filled the air, we felt a wave of relaxation wash over us. The strains of laughter and conversation filled the night, creating an atmosphere of pure bliss. It was a moment of pure freedom, where we could let go of our worries and simply enjoy the present moment.\n\nThe backpackers called Waves provided the perfect backdrop for our 420 celebration. Surrounded by the sounds of crashing waves and the salty scent of the ocean, we felt a deep connection to the natural world. It was a reminder of the beauty and serenity that can be found in even the simplest of moments.\n\nThe construction site, though still a work in progress, added an element of adventure to our gathering. It was as if we were pioneers, creating our own little haven amidst the chaos. The dimly lit surroundings only added to the mystique, making it feel like a secret hideaway.\n\nThroughout the evening, we shared stories, laughter, and good vibes. The conversations flowed freely, as we connected on a deeper level. It was a reminder of the power of community and the joy that comes from shared experiences.\n\nAs the night wore on, we couldn't help but marvel at the beauty of the starry sky above us. The absence of light pollution allowed us to witness the brilliance of the universe in all its glory. It was a humbling experience, reminding us of our place in the vastness of the cosmos.\n\nThe battery bank, our trusted companion throughout the night, kept us going. It was a symbol of our resourcefulness and determination to make the most of every moment. With each passing hour, the energy in the air grew stronger, fueling our spirits and keeping the good times rolling.\n\nAs the clock struck midnight, signaling the end of our 420 adventure, we couldn't help but feel a sense of gratitude. Gratitude for the friends we had made, the memories we had created, and the freedom to celebrate in our own unique way. It was a night that would forever be etched in our hearts.\n\n# Conclusion\n\n420 at Waves was a Friday to remember.

Today is going to be a super productive day. I'm diving into programming during the day, and tonight, it's music time! Lately, I've been practicing combining elements of reggae with other forms of music, and it makes me feel like that's what so many of the popular reggae artists have done. But here's a question for you all: do you think that mixing genres is reggae populism?\n\nWhen we talk about reggae, we often associate it with its roots in Jamaica and the iconic sounds of artists like Bob Marley and Peter Tosh. However, reggae has evolved over the years, embracing influences from various musical styles and cultures. This blending of genres has given birth to a sub-genre known as reggae fusion, where artists infuse reggae with elements of hip-hop, rock, jazz, and more.\n\nThe idea of mixing genres in reggae is not new. In fact, many of the popular reggae artists we admire today have incorporated diverse musical elements into their work. They have fearlessly experimented with different sounds, rhythms, and melodies, creating a unique and captivating fusion that resonates with audiences worldwide.\n\nBut is this blending of genres a form of reggae populism? Does it dilute the essence of reggae or expand its reach to a wider audience? These are questions that spark interesting debates among reggae enthusiasts.\n\nIn my opinion, mixing genres in reggae is not about populism but rather a celebration of diversity and musical exploration. It's about pushing the boundaries of what reggae can be while staying true to its core values of social consciousness, spirituality, and uplifting vibes. By incorporating elements from other genres, reggae artists can reach new listeners who may not have been exposed to the genre before. It opens doors for collaboration, cultural exchange, and the evolution of reggae as an art form.\n\nReggae fusion allows artists to express their creativity and connect with a broader audience. It's a testament to the versatility and adaptability of reggae as a genre. Just like any form of art, reggae evolves with the times, reflecting the influences and experiences of the artists who create it.\n\nAs I embark on my own musical journey, fusing reggae with other genres, I feel a sense of excitement and liberation. It's an opportunity to explore new sonic landscapes, experiment with different rhythms, and create something truly unique. By embracing diversity and mixing genres, I hope to contribute to the ever-evolving tapestry of reggae music.\n\nSo, what are your thoughts on mixing genres in reggae? Do you believe it's a form of populism or a natural progression of the genre? I'd love to hear your perspective and engage in a meaningful discussion. Let's celebrate the richness of reggae music and the power it holds to unite people from all walks of life.\n\nStay tuned for updates on my musical journey as I continue to explore the fusion of reggae with other genres.

It may involve reporting on insignificant, trivial, or tabloid matters and events that do not influence society . It may also invoke a lot of emotion or violate standards of profession and ethics . Sensationalism was invented as a negative term to criticize works of literature or journalism that aimed to arouse strong emotional reactions.\n\n\n\nSensationalism is a threat to media literacy, which is essential to helping people understand the messages that are being broadcasted to them, the biases in media and how they may affect the perception of an event or issue. With an overwhelming source of information, the need for media literacy is more prevalent than ever.\n\n\n\nOne of the emerging challenges for media literacy is the use of AI generated deep fakes, which are synthetic media that manipulate or generate realistic images, videos, or audio of people or events. Deep fakes can be used for various purposes, such as entertainment, education, or research, but they can also be used for malicious purposes, such as spreading misinformation, propaganda, or defamation.\n\n\n\nDeep fakes can be used by sensationalist media to create false or misleading stories that appeal to the emotions or prejudices of the audience. For example, deep fakes can be used to fabricate evidence of scandals, crimes, or conflicts involving celebrities, politicians, or other public figures. Deep fakes can also be used to impersonate or discredit someone's voice or appearance. Deep fakes can be hard to detect by the human eye or ear, especially if they are well-made and distributed through social media platforms.\n\n\n\nThe dangers of sensationalism in media and their use of AI generated deep fakes are manifold. They can erode the trust and credibility of journalism and media outlets. They can undermine the democratic process and influence public opinion and behavior. They can harm the reputation and privacy of individuals and groups. They can incite violence and hatred among different communities.\n\n\n\nTherefore, it is important for media consumers to be aware of the potential risks and harms of sensationalism in media and their use of AI generated deep fakes. It is also important for media producers to adhere to ethical standards and professional codes of conduct when creating and disseminating content. It is also important for media regulators and policymakers to establish clear guidelines and laws to prevent and combat the misuse and abuse of sensationalism in media and their use of AI generated deep fakes.","image":"ipfs://QmWSBBhYeRemeT68t5BrQncaziWTx1FRubNNmZqkxmdoce","media":[{"original":{"url":"ipfs://QmWSBBhYeRemeT68t5BrQncaziWTx1FRubNNmZqkxmdoce","mimeType":"image/png","__typename":"Media"},"__typename":"MediaSet"}],"attributes":[{"displayType":"string","traitType":"type","value":"image","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"}],"__typename":"MetadataOutput"},"Media":[{"original":{"url":"ipfs://QmWSBBhYeRemeT68t5BrQncaziWTx1FRubNNmZqkxmdoce","mimeType":"image/png","__typename":"Media"},"__typename":"MediaSet"}]},{"__typename":"Post","id":"0x01ab41-0x4f","createdAt":"2023-05-05T00:21:52.000Z","metadata":{"name":"It's Just A Fluke ","description":null,"content":"Inspired by 1000 monkeys, I set out to create the ultimate electronic song.","image":"ipfs://bafybeigpfk6lth6xq4sy4hnr7mho2a64svfrwtsnecgwvqdwqozfzg7vqq","media":[{"original":{"url":"ipfs://bafybeigwa6aikaeyghrgj6o2gue4wqwlz2g7c7bqjpmhqls5p6el655bwe","mimeType":"audio/wav","__typename":"Media"},"__typename":"MediaSet"}],"attributes":[{"displayType":"string","traitType":"type","value":"audio","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"},{"displayType":"string","traitType":"genre","value":"Electronic & House","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"},{"displayType":"string","traitType":"author","value":"wooden","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"}],"__typename":"MetadataOutput"},"Media":[{"original":{"url":"ipfs://bafybeigwa6aikaeyghrgj6o2gue4wqwlz2g7c7bqjpmhqls5p6el655bwe","mimeType":"audio/wav","__typename":"Media"},"__typename":"MediaSet"}]},{"__typename":"Post","id":"0x01ab41-0x4e","createdAt":"2023-04-23T15:51:28.000Z","metadata":{"name":"Post by @wooden.lens","description":"Post by @wooden.lens via @wav3s.lens","content":"Achieving full zef\n1 wmatic to collect\nlimited edition (69 collects available)","image":"ipfs://bafybeieq3dl6kqww5j62osxnqhzeujzxft3yfaf6hmkdr2rscsdpvszf7i","media":[{"original":{"url":"ipfs://bafybeieq3dl6kqww5j62osxnqhzeujzxft3yfaf6hmkdr2rscsdpvszf7i","mimeType":"image/jpeg","__typename":"Media"},"__typename":"MediaSet"}],"attributes":[{"displayType":"string","traitType":"createdIn","value":"wav3s","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"},{"displayType":"number","traitType":"mirrorReward","value":"0.1","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"},{"displayType":"number","traitType":"mirrorGoal","value":"15","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"},{"displayType":"number","traitType":"mirrorMinimumFollowers","value":"1500","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"},{"displayType":"string","traitType":"currency","value":"WMATIC","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"},{"displayType":"string","traitType":"silent","value":"false","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"},{"displayType":"string","traitType":"appIdFilter","value":"null","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"},{"displayType":"string","traitType":"poapEventIdFilter","value":"null","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"},{"displayType":"string","traitType":"onlyFollowersFilter","value":"true","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"},{"displayType":"string","traitType":"erc20Filter","value":"null","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"}],"__typename":"MetadataOutput"},"Media":[{"original":{"url":"ipfs://bafybeieq3dl6kqww5j62osxnqhzeujzxft3yfaf6hmkdr2rscsdpvszf7i","mimeType":"image/jpeg","__typename":"Media"},"__typename":"MediaSet"}]},{"__typename":"Post","id":"0x01ab41-0x4a","createdAt":"2023-04-22T00:19:56.000Z","metadata":{"name":"Post by @wooden.lens","description":null,"content":"Narcissism is a personality disorder characterized by an inflated sense of self-importance, a constant need for admiration and attention, and a lack of empathy for others. While some level of self-confidence and self-esteem is healthy, individuals with narcissistic personality disorder take it to an extreme level, to the point where it can interfere with their daily lives and relationships.\n\n\n**Symptoms of Narcissistic Personality Disorder:**\n\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) outlines nine criteria for diagnosing Narcissistic Personality Disorder. \n\n**To be diagnosed, a person must exhibit five or more of the following traits:**\n\nAn exaggerated sense of self-importance\nA preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love\nA belief that they are special and unique and can only be understood by, or should associate with, other special or high-status people or institutions\nA need for excessive admiration\nA sense of entitlement, unreasonable expectations of favorable treatment or compliance with their wishes\nA tendency to exploit or take advantage of others to achieve their own goals\nA lack of empathy and an inability to recognize the needs, feelings, or perspectives of others\nEnvious of others or believes others are envious of them\nArrogant, haughty behaviors or attitudes\n\n\n**Causes of Narcissistic Personality Disorder:**\n\nThe exact cause of Narcissistic Personality Disorder is unknown. However, researchers believe that both genetic and environmental factors may play a role. It's believed that individuals who have experienced neglect, abuse, or trauma in childhood may be more likely to develop narcissistic traits as a coping mechanism. Additionally, personality traits such as high levels of neuroticism and low levels of agreeableness may also contribute to the development of Narcissistic Personality Disorder.\n\n\n**Effects of Narcissistic Personality Disorder:**\n\nIndividuals with Narcissistic Personality Disorder often have difficulty maintaining healthy relationships, as their constant need for attention and admiration can be exhausting and overwhelming for others. They may struggle to understand and empathize with others' emotions and perspectives, leading to a lack of intimacy and meaningful connections.\n\n\nAdditionally, individuals with Narcissistic Personality Disorder may struggle with anxiety, depression, and substance abuse, as they try to cope with feelings of inadequacy and insecurity. They may also have difficulty accepting criticism or acknowledging their own mistakes, which can lead to conflict and negative interactions with others.\n\n\n**Treatment for Narcissistic Personality Disorder:**\n\nWhile Narcissistic Personality Disorder is a challenging condition to treat, psychotherapy can be beneficial for individuals with this disorder. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can help individuals with Narcissistic Personality Disorder learn to recognize and change their negative thought patterns and behaviors. Group therapy can also be helpful, as it provides a safe and supportive environment for individuals with Narcissistic Personality Disorder to work on their relationships and communication skills.\n\n\nIn some cases, medication may also be prescribed to help manage symptoms of depression and anxiety.\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nNarcissistic Personality Disorder is a challenging condition that can significantly impact an individual's personal and professional life. However, with the right treatment and support, individuals with this disorder can learn to manage their symptoms and build healthier, more meaningful relationships. If you or someone you know is struggling with Narcissistic Personality Disorder, it's essential to seek help from a qualified mental health professional.\n\n","image":"ipfs://bafkreiaxlzoj32p7vdm5ybyj5uw3p35qeoal6hhme42s7ih3rf5i527r5a","media":[{"original":{"url":"ipfs://bafkreiaxlzoj32p7vdm5ybyj5uw3p35qeoal6hhme42s7ih3rf5i527r5a","mimeType":"image/png","__typename":"Media"},"__typename":"MediaSet"}],"attributes":[{"displayType":"string","traitType":"type","value":"image","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"}],"__typename":"MetadataOutput"},"Media":[{"original":{"url":"ipfs://bafkreiaxlzoj32p7vdm5ybyj5uw3p35qeoal6hhme42s7ih3rf5i527r5a","mimeType":"image/png","__typename":"Media"},"__typename":"MediaSet"}]},{"__typename":"Post","id":"0x01ab41-0x49","createdAt":"2023-04-22T00:01:11.000Z","metadata":{"name":"Post by @wooden.lens","description":null,"content":"The concept of evil has been a perennial philosophical and ethical concern throughout history.

These programs are usually advertised through flashy websites and marketing materials, and they offer returns that are significantly higher than what traditional investments like stocks and bonds provide. However, the returns that these programs promise are often too good to be true, and in many cases, they are scams designed to separate investors from their money.\n\nHYIPs operate through online platforms and websites that market their services to potential investors. These websites often feature testimonials from supposed satisfied customers and promises of high returns. The operators of these programs claim to use investors' money to invest in high-return ventures, such as real estate, stocks, or foreign exchange markets. They promise to pay investors a high rate of interest or dividends in exchange for their investment.\n\nWhile some HYIPs may actually invest a portion of investors' money in legitimate ventures, the returns promised by these programs are often inflated or completely false. In some cases, HYIPs operate as Ponzi schemes, using new investors' money to pay returns to earlier investors. This allows the operators of the scheme to make off with investors' money, leaving them with nothing.\n\nHYIPs scam investors by promising unrealistic returns, providing false information about their operations and investments, operating as a Ponzi scheme, offering referral commissions, and disappearing with investors' money. To protect yourself from HYIP scams, you should always do your due diligence before investing in any opportunity. You should be wary of promises of high returns with little risk, lack of transparency about the company's operations or investments, pressure to invest quickly or recruit others, poor track record or negative reviews from other investors, and lack of regulation or oversight by financial authorities.\n\nIn conclusion, HYIPs are scams that promise high returns in a short period of time. You should approach them with extreme caution and do your research before investing in any opportunity. Remember, if an investment opportunity seems too good to be true, it probably is.\n\n#scam","image":null,"media":[],"attributes":[{"displayType":"string","traitType":"createdIn","value":"wav3s","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"},{"displayType":"number","traitType":"mirrorReward","value":"0.1","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"},{"displayType":"number","traitType":"mirrorGoal","value":"15","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"},{"displayType":"number","traitType":"mirrorMinimumFollowers","value":"15000","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"},{"displayType":"string","traitType":"currency","value":"WMATIC","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"},{"displayType":"string","traitType":"silent","value":"false","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"},{"displayType":"string","traitType":"appIdFilter","value":"null","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"},{"displayType":"string","traitType":"poapEventIdFilter","value":"null","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"},{"displayType":"string","traitType":"onlyFollowersFilter","value":"false","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"},{"displayType":"string","traitType":"erc20Filter","value":"null","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"}],"__typename":"MetadataOutput"},"Media":[]},{"__typename":"Post","id":"0x01ab41-0x2c","createdAt":"2023-04-19T21:32:14.000Z","metadata":{"name":"Degen Video #5","description":"Rock out ya'll\n\n#onlybots\n\n#iamarobot\n\n#wedoalittletrolling\n\n#wagmi\n\n#gm\n\n#memeswillsavetheworld\n\n#killtheuniverse\n\n#hashtag\n\n#irobot\n\n#meme\n\n#yourmomisgay","content":"Degen Video #5\n\nRock out ya'll\n\n#onlybots\n\n#iamarobot\n\n#wedoalittletrolling\n\n#wagmi\n\n#gm\n\n#memeswillsavetheworld\n\n#killtheuniverse\n\n#hashtag\n\n#irobot\n\n#meme\n\n#yourmomisgay","image":"ipfs://bafybeicv4kjd5iirtbydillud7awbsyr4dnpcxv2mqgxpxgfo36h5p2sui","media":[{"original":{"url":"ipfs://bafybeifvcebo2iwx4ae3tzuk7ojnm4fl2ry2xiqda56qsbeu3nthnai77m","mimeType":"video/mp4","__typename":"Media"},"__typename":"MediaSet"}],"attributes":[{"displayType":"string","traitType":"handle","value":"wooden.lens","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"},{"displayType":"string","traitType":"app","value":"lenstube","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"},{"displayType":"string","traitType":"durationInSeconds","value":"449.88","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"}],"__typename":"MetadataOutput"},"Media":[{"original":{"url":"ipfs://bafybeifvcebo2iwx4ae3tzuk7ojnm4fl2ry2xiqda56qsbeu3nthnai77m","mimeType":"video/mp4","__typename":"Media"},"__typename":"MediaSet"}]},{"__typename":"Post","id":"0x01ab41-0x2b","createdAt":"2023-04-18T13:36:30.000Z","metadata":{"name":"Post by @wooden.lens","description":"Post by @wooden.lens via @wav3s.lens","content":"NESARA, or the National Economic Security and Recovery Act, is a conspiracy theory that has been circulating online since the late 1990s.

Be good and you will be good at everything that you do.\"\n\nAs humans, we often deceive ourselves with lies to justify our wrongdoings. This can ultimately lead to our downfall, as we may lose sight of our innate ability to do good. We underestimate the power of our words and actions on our own well-being. While it is understandable to feel powerless in a challenging world, we have the potential to change our circumstances for better or for worse.\n\nIf we aspire to greatness, we must consistently strive for it. Our efforts towards goodness will eventually be rewarded, although this process may not be immediate, as the universe does not always favor the easy way out.\n\nConsider cryptocurrency as an example. Instant wealth may leave some feeling empty, as they may not have done anything to truly deserve it. This can lead to a sense of unfulfillment and a nagging feeling that they could be doing something more meaningful.\n\nGreed can lead us to believe that we need more, but this desire often leads to more problems instead of happiness. It is crucial to recognize that we have the power to shape our destiny and that our choices can have a significant impact on our lives. We must resist the urge to indulge in greed, as it can only lead to temporary gains and long-term regrets.\n\nIt is essential to stay true to our values and strive for greatness through meaningful actions. Instead of making excuses for our mistakes, we should take responsibility for our actions and work towards becoming better versions of ourselves. Only then can we achieve true happiness and fulfillment in life.\n\n#onlybots\n\n#gm\n\n#begood\n\n#memesagainstscamming","image":"ipfs://bafybeifzduqbschnj6gt2qw2upob62stczsdh3v36w65s5aqaxgzhqasei","media":[{"original":{"url":"ipfs://bafybeifzduqbschnj6gt2qw2upob62stczsdh3v36w65s5aqaxgzhqasei","mimeType":"video/quicktime","__typename":"Media"},"__typename":"MediaSet"}],"attributes":[{"displayType":"string","traitType":"createdIn","value":"wav3s","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"},{"displayType":"number","traitType":"mirrorReward","value":"0.1","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"},{"displayType":"number","traitType":"mirrorGoal","value":"15","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"},{"displayType":"number","traitType":"mirrorMinimumFollowers","value":"500","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"},{"displayType":"string","traitType":"currency","value":"WMATIC","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"},{"displayType":"string","traitType":"silent","value":"false","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"},{"displayType":"string","traitType":"appIdFilter","value":"null","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"},{"displayType":"string","traitType":"poapEventIdFilter","value":"null","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"},{"displayType":"string","traitType":"onlyFollowersFilter","value":"false","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"},{"displayType":"string","traitType":"erc20Filter","value":"null","__typename":"MetadataAttributeOutput"}],"__typename":"MetadataOutput"},"Media":[{"original":{"url":"ipfs://bafybeifzduqbschnj6gt2qw2upob62stczsdh3v36w65s5aqaxgzhqasei","mimeType":"video/quicktime","__typename":"Media"},"__typename":"MediaSet"}]},{"__typename":"Post","id":"0x01ab41-0x1f","createdAt":"2023-04-15T22:42:03.000Z","metadata":{"name":"Degenerate
